Meta-Code Engine

Meta-Code Engine is an experimental program analysis tool that examines Python source code and produces a structured reasoning report describing how the code behaves.

Instead of only checking style or syntax like a linter, Meta-Code Engine attempts to interpret the logic and intent of a program.
---
Quick Example

Paste Python code:

def process(data):
    result = 0
    for item in data:
        if item > 10:
            result += item
    return result

Meta-Code Engine returns a reasoning summary:

Detected Behavior

- Iteration over a collection
- Conditional filtering
- Accumulator pattern

Logical Interpretation

«The function scans a dataset and sums only values greater than 10.»

Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Linear pass through input

Risk Notes

- Fails if "data" is empty or non-iterable
- Assumes comparable values

You are not reading code anymore — you are reading an explanation.

---

It answers questions such as:

• What structures does this program use?
• What patterns appear in the logic?
• How complex is the execution flow?
• Where are potential logical risks?
• What is the code trying to do?

The goal is not to run the code — but to understand it.

---

What It Is

Meta-Code Engine is a static analysis and reasoning system built on top of Python's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
It parses source code and converts it into a semantic analysis report that a human can read.

The system sits between a linter and a debugger:

Tool| What it checks
Linter| Style problems
Debugger| Runtime state
Meta-Code Engine| Program behavior and structure

The engine does not execute your code.
It studies the logic of the program itself.

Why This Exists

Reading unfamiliar code is one of the hardest tasks in programming.

Developers often need to understand:
• legacy code
• open-source projects
• large scripts
• AI-generated code
• partially broken programs

Meta-Code Engine helps by producing an explanation layer over source code.

Think of it as:

«A translator between human reasoning and program structure.»

---

Features

Structural Analysis

Identifies functions, loops, branches, and control flow structures.

Complexity Insights

Estimates logical complexity and nesting depth.

Pattern Detection

Recognizes recurring programming constructs and common design patterns.

Risk Reporting

Highlights areas that may lead to logical errors or fragile behavior.

Human-Readable Reports

Returns structured findings instead of raw parser output.

How It Works

1. The browser UI sends Python code to the backend.
2. A Flask API receives the code.
3. The MetaCodeEngine parses the code using Python's "ast" module.
4. The engine analyzes the syntax tree.
5. A structured "AnalysisReport" is generated.
6. Results are returned as JSON and displayed in the interface.

Pipeline:

Browser → Flask API → MetaCodeEngine → AnalysisReport → JSON → UI

---

Example Use Cases

• Understanding unfamiliar GitHub projects
• Reviewing AI-generated code (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
• Teaching programming concepts
• Inspecting legacy software
• Early logical auditing before execution
• Code comprehension assistance

---

Installation

git clone https://github.com/KnottNefarious/meta-code-engine.git
cd meta-code-engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

Then open:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

---

Example

Input:

def find_max(numbers):
    max_value = numbers[0]
    for n in numbers:
        if n > max_value:
            max_value = n
    return max_value

Meta-Code Engine will identify:
• iteration over a collection
• conditional state update
• accumulator pattern
• linear complexity

---

Current Limitations

Meta-Code Engine currently:
• requires syntactically valid Python
• does not execute code
• does not perform symbolic execution (yet)
• focuses on structural reasoning rather than formal verification

This project is experimental and evolving.

---

Future Direction

Planned research directions include:
• symbolic reasoning about variables
• detecting unreachable branches
• termination prediction
• deeper behavioral inference

The long-term vision is a system that can reason about programs rather than merely run them.

---

Philosophy

Programs are not only instructions for computers.
They are expressions of human logic.

Meta-Code Engine explores whether software can be analyzed as meaning, not only as execution.
